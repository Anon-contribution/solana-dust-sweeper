### Description

This web3 app allow swapping of multiple tokens into USDC or SOL.
I developed it because i often have 4-5 coins around who worth each less than $1 and
can't bother to do 5 swaps straight one after the other then manually close accounts for all. 

# TODO

- fix wallet transaction multi-popups instead of one
    -> DONE ?

- Fix UI quote USDC value

# Roadmap

- add asset filtering (max $ value) & ordering
- Implement UI using CSS library
